- **class** : Named group of properties and functions

- **Main** : Name of the file

- **main** : Reserved keyword for function to help the java compiler 
find out the start of execution (entry point of the program). Code cannot run without this method.

- **static** : Is the specifier, any feature that has static, belongs to the class. This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class.
